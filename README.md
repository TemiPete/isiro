# isiro

"Isiro" is a Yoruba word for computation or calculation. This repo or folder contains thoughts, ideas, explorations, projects, and concepts I find interesting in statistics, machine learning, and genetics, and that I want to learn more about, write about, or just generally explore. The .Rmd or .html files are used to render the projects page on my (personal? academic?) website, https://temipete.github.io.
